This is the long presentation that I delivered at ICML 2022 for the paper [Contrastive Mixture of Posteriors for Counterfactual Inference, Data Integration and Fairness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.08161).
The project was born out of several "grand challenges" in computational biology and the analysis of single-cell RNA-seq data.
One challenge is integrating different datasets that exhibit some kind of technical variation.
Another is predicting the effects of drugs and gene knock-outs on certain cells.
In this project, we were able to translate these problems into a representation learning setting and then focus on computational methods to enforce the all-important contraint: z independent of c.
