This is the talk that I delivered to AISTATS 2020 for the paper [A Unified Stochastic Gradient Approach to Designing Bayesian-Optimal Experiments](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.00294). 
The talk offers a short primer on Bayesian Experimental Design, before launching into the key problem of optimizing Expected Information Gain using stochastic gradient methods.
