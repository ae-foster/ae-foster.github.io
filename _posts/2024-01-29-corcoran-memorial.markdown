I was truly grateful to [be awarded the 2022 Corcoran Memorial Prize](https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/news/2022-corcoran-memorial-prize-winner) in recognition of an outstanding DPhil thesis. 
The Corcoran Memorial lectures are named in memory of Stephen Corcoran who was a graduate student in the Department of Statistics at the University of Oxford until his death in 1996.
A family bequest has established an annual lecture in honour of Stephen in which distinguished guest lecturers are invited to deliver a lecture on important aspects of their work, in my case,
Professor Michael Gutmann from the School of Informatics, University of Edinburgh gave a talk on 'Self-supervised learning for Bayesian experimental design'.
I then delivered a talk on part of my DPhil work, entitled 'Concepts in Modern Bayesian Experimental Design'.
My lecture begins with a Bayesian viewpoint on the "weighing prisoners on an island" puzzle which appeared, among other places, on the show [Brooklyn 99](https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/questions/9979/brooklyn-99-riddle-weighing-islanders).
