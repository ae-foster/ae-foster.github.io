This is the talk, based on our paper [A Unified Stochastic Gradient Approach to Designing Bayesian-Optimal Experiments](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.00294) that I delivered as an invited speaker at the Minisymposium on Model-Based Optimal Experimental Design at SIAM CSE 21.
In the talk, I cover the basics of experimental design with Expected Information Gain (EIG), and then turn to the question of how to efficiently optimize this quantity over a large continuous design space without resorting to inefficient methods like Bayes Opt.
