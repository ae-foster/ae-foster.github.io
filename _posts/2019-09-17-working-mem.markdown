This tutorial serves as an introduction to designing optimal experiments using Pyro. The tutorial works through a specific example of this entire optimal experimental design (OED) procedure with multiple rounds of experiments. The tutorial focuses on how to design adaptive psychology experiments to learn a participantâ€™s working memory capacity. The design that is adapted is the length of a sequence of digits that we ask a participant to remember.
